## Tech

ThreeJS uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [ReactJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Material UI] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [nodejs.org] - evented I/O for the backend
- [ViteJS] - fast react.js frontend web tool
- [GLTF] - creates a pipeline to convert 3D models to JSX files
- [jQuery] - duh
- [JavaScript] - bruuh



## Installation
